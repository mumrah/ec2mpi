A command line interface for managing MPI cluters on Amazon EC2. Clusters are
represented as EC2 reservations. For now no public AMI exists to use this
script, but eventually I'll probably release it.

Required Python packages
boto - Amazon API
M2Crypto - generating RSA keys
paramiko - SSH module

Required Amazin Services
EC2 - for the clusters themselves
SimpleDB - maintaining meta information about clusters
S3 - storing keys for MPI networking

Also requires a file named "config.py" that has the following variables (all
available from http://aws.amazon.com under Your Account->Access Identifiers)
ACCESS_KEY_ID
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
USER_ID
